# Computer Set-Up 

## Hardware Recommendations 

You should have a reliable laptop or desktop computer for coursework. A tablet is not suitable for the work because it will not be able to suport software you will use in classes. 

We don't have specific hardware requirements but we recommend the following minimum specs to work with the types of data files or computational procedures you will encounter in the program: 

* At least 8 Gigs of RAM 
* At least 50 GB of storage available for labs and projects 
* High-speed internet 
* Any operating system is fine (Windows or Apple) but no support will be provided for Linux and Apple machines require more time configuring software 

R is a memory-intensive program, so more RAM is better. You can find a solid laptop with 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage for about $750, or 16GB-32GB of RAM and 5000 - 1,000 GB of storage for about $1,000. The ASUS ZenBook, for example, is a good benchmark for affordable but reliable options. 

Desktops will typically offer you more power for the same price since it doesn't require miniturized components and doesn't have to withstand the abuse a laptop does. The Dell Inspiron is a good benchmark for affordable yet reliable options. 

If you are on a budget consider buying a refurbished machine from a licensed supplier. You can find nice desktop towers for $250. Note that the quality-assurance testing requirements for refurbished machines are often higher than for new computers, so many refurbished machines are inexpensive but reliable. Often times large companies or schools have contracts where machines are replaced each year, so buying a refurbished computer is like buying a used car from a rental company - a steep discount on something that is low miles and well-maintained. Other times a refurbished computer might be a product that was opened and then returned to a retailer, in which case it is essentially new. Just make sure to buy from a reputable vender that has a good track record (good reviews) and a good warranty on their work (one year maintenance or replacement). I also recommend buying something off of a marketplace like Amazon since they will cover shipping costs if you have to return anything and if the vender is not responsive Amazon will be able to settle a dispute and can refund your money if necessary, offering additional protection if you do run into problems. 


## Software Installation 

Prior to your first class make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

* [R Data Programming Language (core R)](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [R Studio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) 
* [GitHub User Account](https://github.com/join)
* [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) 

We will be using R extensively for core courses in the program. R is a free open-source program developed specifically for statistics and data analytics.

R Studio provides a nice user interface and some powerful tools to extend R. 

GitHub is a collaboration tool for data analytics. We will use the platform for distributing course materials and hosting review sessions. You will need a GitHub account for some course work. 

**NOTE that GitHub is a professional platform that will be visible to future employers and you cannot change your username once your account is created, so select your username accordingly**.

## Markdown 

Data-driven documents are the new standard way to document analysis and create professional reports. A document is data-driven if it not only includes tables, models, or graphics from your analysis, but also the code used to produce the results. 

They are the gold standard for modern analytics because it makes the process transparent and reproducible. The author not only reports the results of the analysis, but also how the results were achieved. They are becoming standard practice for teams working on projects, managers that need to inspect work of junior analysts, and scholars that would like to publish in top journals. 

Markdown is a small set of text formatting rules used to create data-driven documents. R Markdown is an extension of Markdown that allows you to combine code and text in the same document. 

Learn more about data-driven documents here: [Introducing Data-Driven Docs](https://ds4ps.org/docs/)

# Getting Registered 

## Your ASU Student Account 

Upon admissions to the program you will receive information about activating your ASU student account. This account is important because it gives you access to: 

* Registration for courses 
* Your ASU email account 
* Free software licenses such as MS Office and Zoom 
* Access to courses on Canvas 

Make sure you are checking your ASU email account regularly, as it is the official mode of communication with instructors and advisors. 


## Preliminary Advising Meetings

If you have any questions about the program structure (sequence of classes, electives, and the capstone project) be sure to schedule a meeting with your academic advisor.

Crystal Ramirez is the Academic Advisor for PEDA students. She can be reached at idpadvising@asu.edu or 602-496-1019. 

*Please include your ASURITE ID for a faster response.*

## Program Handbook 

The handbook is your official guide for the program and explains all of the degree requirements in detail, including:

[HANDBOOK](https://ds4ps.org/ms-prog-eval-data-analytics/handbook/)

* Required program courses and concentration options 
* Pace of program and recommended first semester classes
* Sample schedules
* How to Register for classes
* Transfer Coursework
* Important ASU and College Policies 



## Ongoing Registration Requirements 

You MUST enroll in at least one class during the semester you were admitted in order to remain in the system. 

If you are unable to begin right away please contact your advisor as soon as possible so that you are not withdrawn from the program for non-registration.

You must register for at least ... credits each semester to remain in good standing.


## Course Catalog 

You can search for available courses on the ASU Course Catalog page: [https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/](https://webapp4.asu.edu/catalog/)

MS-PEDA students are limited to ASU Online classes, so select that filter. 


## Core Course Offerings 

There are occassional changes, but the core PEDA courses will be offered according to the following schedule: 

| COURSE  |  FALL  |  SPRING  |  SUMMER |  
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |  
| CPP 526 Data Science I   | A | A | B |  
| CPP 527 Data Science II  | B | B |  |  
| CPP 528 Data Science III | B | B |  |  
| CPP 523 Program Eval I   | A | A | A |  
| CPP 524 Program Eval II  | A | A | A |  
| CPP 525 Program Eval III | B | B | B |  
| CPP 529 Community Analytics | B | B |  |  
| CPP 586 Capstone | C | C | C |  



## Electives 

Electives can be selected from across the university, but some popular electives include: 

* Example 1 
* Example 2 
* Example 3 

ASU is a huge institution so new courses are frequently offered. Availability will depend entirely upon the departments that offer the electives. The ASU academic catalog will have the most up-to-date information on courses. 

## Academic Calendar

The ASU Academic Calendar will list important dates and deadlines such as semester start dates, registration deadlines, withdrawl deadlines, religious holidays and mid-semester breaks:

# Getting Started

If you have successfully installed all of the software and you have time before the first course you can explore some of the tools through the videos below. 

**RStudio** helps you manage projects by organizing files, scripts, packages and output. **Markdown** is a simple formatting convention that allows you to create publication-quality documents. **R Markdown** is a specific version of Markdown that allows you to combine text and code to create data-driven documents.
