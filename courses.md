# CAPSTONE
* Applied consulting project with a public or nonprofit organization
* Students must analyze a problem, propose a solution, and implement
* Should relate to conducting and impact study or building a performance system
* Use a 15-week format, but is still 3 credits

<br>

## Example Capstone Projects
* [Using LIDAR Data for a Tree Census](https://castower.github.io/cpp-593-treeproject-site/)  
  - [The lidR Package](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/blob/master/README.md)  
  - [Tree Canopy Analysis using rLiDAR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ForestTools/vignettes/treetop_analysis.html)

# Example Schedules

Online courses are 7.5 weeks long and organized as two sessions (A and B) each semester. A full-time student could complete the program by taking courses in this order:



_**SEMESTER 1**_ 

Session A                  |    |   Session B  
----------------------------|----|------------------------------  
CPP 523 Program Eval I       |    |  SWK 623 Applied Evaluation  
CPP 526 Data Science I       |    |  CPP 529 Data Practicum  


_**SEMESTER 2**_   

Session A                    |    |   Session B 
-----------------------------|----|------------------------------
CPP 524 Program Eval II      |    |  CPP 525 Program Eval III 
CPP 527 Data Science II      |    |  CPP 528 Data Science III 


_**SEMESTER 3**_  

Session A                    |    |   Session B  
----------------------------|----|------------------------------  
Capstone (15 weeks  --> )     |    |  Capstone continued  
Elective      |    |  Elective  


Part-time students would approach the course sequences in a different way, and there are also certificate options for Program Evaluation (5 courses) or Data Science (5 courses).
